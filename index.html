        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <h3>Smart Energy Meter</h3>
            <p>The "Smart Energy Meter" project is a groundbreaking initiative poised to transform 
                conventional energy metering systems. By integrating cutting-edge technologies such as IoT and 
                data analytics, it provides users with real-time monitoring of their electricity consumption. This 
                allows consumers to gain valuable insights into their energy usage patterns, empowering them to 
                make informed decisions and optimize efficiency. With remote control capabilities and a userfriendly mobile app, individuals can actively manage their energy consumption. Beyond cost 
                savings, this project promotes environmental responsibility, contributing to a more sustainable 
                future by reducing energy wastage. In essence, the Smart Energy Meter project signifies a 
                significant leap toward smarter and eco-conscious energy usage.
            </p>
        <H3>IoT Based Monitoring and Prevention Of Road Accidents Using Alcohol 
            and Eye Blink Sensors </H3>
            <p>This project pioneers IoT technology to revolutionize road safety by combating two 
                major causes of accidents: alcohol impairment and drowsy driving. It integrates alcohol detection 
                and eye blink analysis sensors, continuously monitoring drivers in real-time. When alcohol levels 
                exceed safe limits or signs of drowsiness emerge, the system issues immediate alerts and triggers 
                automated safety measures, such as slowing the vehicle or alerting authorities. Beyond accident 
                prevention, it promotes heightened driver awareness and gathers valuable data for road safety 
                analysis. In essence, this initiative not only transforms road safety but also contributes to informed 
                policy decisions, heralding a safer and more responsible future on the roads.
            </p>
        <h3>IoT Based Plant Monitoring And Growing Under LED Using Node MCU</h3>
        <p>The "IoT-Based Plant Monitoring and Growth Control Under LED Using Node MCU" 
            project pioneers the fusion of IoT and Node MCU technology for indoor agriculture. By 
            orchestrating LED lighting to replicate optimal growth conditions while collecting real-time 
            environmental data, it enhances crop health and yield. This initiative enables year-round 
            cultivation, remote monitoring, and resource-efficient farming, all contributing to a sustainable 
            and productive agricultural future. In essence, it represents a forward-looking solution for modern 
            farming practices, ensuring healthier crops and more eco-conscious agriculture.
